Hi! I'm Dmitry Slutsky aka Lakret.

I'm a software developer/engineering manager/software architect with experience primarily in everythning web, distributed systems, big data applications, AI/ML, and functional programming.

I run an educational YouTube channel about algorithms, Rust, Elixir, Julia, and other fun technologies.
